/**************************** ConvolveOp support ****************************/

/**
 * The ConvolveOp shader is fairly straightforward.  For each texel in
 * the source texture, the shader samples the MxN texels in the surrounding
 * area, multiplies each by its corresponding kernel value, and then sums
 * them all together to produce a single color result.  Finally, the
 * resulting value is multiplied by the current OpenGL color, which contains
 * the extra alpha value.
 *
 * Note that this shader source code includes some "holes" marked by "%s".
 * This allows us to build different shader programs (e.g. one for
 * 3x3, one for 5x5, and so on) simply by filling in these "holes" with
 * a call to sprintf().  See the MTLBufImgOps_CreateConvolveProgram() method
 * for more details.
 *
 * REMIND: Currently this shader (and the supporting code in the
 *         EnableConvolveOp() method) only supports 3x3 and 5x5 filters.
 *         Early shader-level hardware did not support non-constant sized
 *         arrays but modern hardware should support them (although I
 *         don't know of any simple way to find out, other than to compile
 *         the shader at runtime and see if the drivers complain).

/**************************** LookupOp support ******************************/

/**
 * The LookupOp shader takes a fragment color (from the source texture) as
 * input, subtracts the optional user offset value, and then uses the
 * resulting value to index into the lookup table texture to provide
 * a new color result.  Finally, the resulting value is multiplied by
 * the current OpenGL color, which contains the extra alpha value.
 *
 * The lookup step requires 3 texture accesses (or 4, when alpha is included),
 * which is somewhat unfortunate because it's not ideal from a performance
 * standpoint, but that sort of thing is getting faster with newer hardware.
 * In the 3-band case, we could consider using a three-dimensional texture
 * and performing the lookup with a single texture access step.  We already
 * use this approach in the LCD text shader, and it works well, but for the
 * purposes of this LookupOp shader, it's probably overkill.  Also, there's
 * a difference in that the LCD text shader only needs to populate the 3D LUT
 * once, but here we would need to populate it on every invocation, which
 * would likely be a waste of VRAM and CPU/GPU cycles.
 *
 * The LUT texture is currently hardcoded as 4 rows/bands, each containing
 * 256 elements.  This means that we currently only support user-provided
 * tables with no more than 256 elements in each band (this is checked at
 * at the Java level).  If the user provides a table with less than 256
 * elements per band, our shader will still work fine, but if elements are
 * accessed with an index >= the size of the LUT, then the shader will simply
 * produce undefined values.  Typically the user would provide an offset
 * value that would prevent this from happening, but it's worth pointing out
 * this fact because the software LookupOp implementation would usually
 * throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in this scenario (although it is
 * not something demanded by the spec).
 *
 * The LookupOp spec says that the operation is performed regardless of
 * whether the source data is premultiplied or non-premultiplied.  This is
 * a problem for the OpenGL pipeline in that a non-premultiplied
 * BufferedImage will have already been converted into premultiplied
 * when uploaded to an OpenGL texture.  Therefore, we have a special mode
 * called LOOKUP_NON_PREMULT (used only for source images that were
 * originally non-premultiplied) that un-premultiplies the source color
 * prior to the lookup operation, then re-premultiplies the resulting
 * color before returning from the fragment shader.
 *
 * Note that this shader source code includes some "holes" marked by "%s".
 * This allows us to build different shader programs (e.g. one for
 * GL_TEXTURE_2D targets, one for GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB targets, and so on)
 * simply by filling in these "holes" with a call to sprintf().  See the
